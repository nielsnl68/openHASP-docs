# Styling Properties

You can adjust the appearance of objects by changing the foreground, background and/or border color of each object.
Some objects allow for more complex styling, effectively changing the appearance of their sub-components.     

## Propery naming convention 


The styling properties below support an optional two-digit suffix to indicate which **part** and/or **state** of the object the property applies to.
A styling property without suffix will be applied to the **default state** of the **main part** of the object *(i.e. the background)*.

Very detailed styling can be applied to each part depending on the state of the object:

### Parts

All objects have at least a main part.
Several objects are made up of additional parts which can each be styled separately.
To access the properties of the parts use a two-digit suffix appended to the styling properties below.

The part indexes are:

- 00 = main part of the object *(i.e. the background)*
- 10 = the indicator or needle, highlighting the the current value
- 20 = the knob which can be used the change the value
- 30 = the background of the items/buttons
- 40 = the items/buttons
- 50 = the selected item
- 60 = major ticks of the gauge object
- 70 = the text cursor
- 80 = the scrollbar
- 90 = other special part, not listed above

!!! tip  
    For example the _gauge_ object uses `line_width` to set the minor ticks thickness, `line_width60` for major ticks and `line_width10` for the thickness of the needle.
    

### States

The state indexes:

- 00 = default styling
- 01 = styling for toggled state
- 02 = styling for pressed, not toggled state
- 03 = styling for pressed and toggled state
- 04 = styling for disabled not toggled state
- 05 = styling for disabled and toggled state

For example to set the `radius` of all the buttons in _btnmatrix_ you'd set a value for the property `radius30`. Using `radius` without a suffix will apply the property to the outline background of it.

A `toggle` `btn` can be made to show `text` `yellow` when toggled ON with `"text_color":"white","text_color01":"yellow"`
    

### Inheritance

If objects are children of other objects (they have the [parentid][7] property set), property inheritance takes place. 

Some properties (typically that are related to text and opacity) can be inherited from the parent object's styles. Inheritance is applied only if the given property is not set in the initial jsonl of the child object (at first draw). In this case, if the property is inheritable, the property's value will be searched in the parents too until an object specifies a value for the property. The parents will use their own state to detemine the value. So for example if a button is pressed, and the text color comes from here, the pressed text color will be used. ([source][8]{target=_blank}) Inheritance takes place at run time too.     

When a parent object is deleted, all children will be deleted too.

## General

General styling options.

| Property     | Value      | Default | Description
|:-------------|:----------:|:-------:|:-----------
| radius       | [uint16][3]| depends<BR>on theme | The radius of the rounded corners of the object:<BR>0 = no radius i.e. square corners<BR>65535 = pill shaped object (true circle if object has same width and height)
| clip_corner  | [bool][2] | false   | Enable to clip off the overflowed content on the rounded (`radius > 0`) corners of the object


## Background

The color and gradient used for drawing the background of an object.

| Property       |   Type   | Description
| :---           |   :---:  | :---
| bg_opa         | [uint8][3]     | The background opacity level
| bg_color       |[color][1]| The background color
| bg_grad_color  |[color][1]| The background gradient color
| bg_grad_dir    | [0..2]   | 0 = none *(=default)*<br>1 = horizontal<br>2 = vertical
| bg_grad_stop   | [uint8][3]     | Specifies where the gradient should stop.<br>0 = at left/top most position<br>128 = in the center<br>255 = at right/bottom most position *(=default)*

To adjust the background style of a page use `pXb0` where `X` is the page number.

## Border

The border is drawn on top of the background. It has radius rounding.

| Property     |  Type    | Description
| :---         |  :---:   | :---
| border_color |[color][1]| Specifies the color of the border
| border_opa   | [uint8][3]     | Specifies opacity of the border
| border_width | [uint8][3]     | Set the width of the border
| border_side  | [uint8][3]     | Specifies which sides of the border to draw.<br>0 = none<br>1 = bottom<br>2 = top<br>4 = left<br>8 = right<br>15 = full<br>A sum of these values is also possible to select specific sides.
| border_post  | [bool][2]| If `true` the border will be drawn after all children have been drawn.

## Outline

The outline is similar to border but is drawn outside of the object.

| Property     |  Type     | Description
| :---         |  :---:    | :---
| outline_color|[color][1] | Specifies the color of the outline

| outline_width| [uint8][3]| Set the width of the outline
| outline_pad  | [int16][3]| The space between the object and the outline. (default=0)

## Padding and Margin

Padding sets the space on the inner sides of the edges. It means "I don't want my children too close to my sides, so keep this space". Padding inner sets the "gap" between the children. Margin sets the space on the outer side of the edges. It means "I want this space around me".

Objects use them to set spacing. See the documentation of the [objects](../objects/) for the details.

| pad_right     | [int16][3] | Set the padding on the right
| pad_inner     | [int16][3] | Set the padding inside the object between children
| margin_top    | [int16][3] | Set the margin on the top
| margin_bottom | [int16][3] | Set the margin on the bottom
